# Train_Time
This application creates a train schedule that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.  The end product will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive to their corresponding stations.
